    <h1>A <span class='beauty'>Beauty</span>-ful Beginning</h1>
    <div class='container about'>
      
      <p><span class='beauty'>Beauty Box</span> was started as a demo/concept project by Donna Bradshaw.
        Donna never wore makeup.  However, she constantly saw how it made
        some women feel better in their skin.
      </p>

      <p>She is a work-a-holic. Donna is constantly on the go. She is someone who 
        would never have time to go out and purchase the makeup she needed 
        (much less the kind she wanted). Realizing there are many other women who 
        work a lot as well, she wanted to make the glamour life a little easier.
      </p>

      <p>Hence <span class='beauty'>Beauty Box</span> was created.</p>
